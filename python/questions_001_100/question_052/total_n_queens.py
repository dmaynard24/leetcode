# N-Queens II

# Problem 52
# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

# Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

# Example:
# Input: 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
# [
#  [".Q..",  // Solution 1
#   "...Q",
#   "Q...",
#   "..Q."],

#  ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
#   "Q...",
#   "...Q",
#   ".Q.."]
